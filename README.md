# PyIceberg with Cache

Manage your tables with swiftness with the addition of Parquet file caching in PyIceberg.

## Description
Iceberg is an open table format for large-scale data lakes, that has become increasingly suitable for huge analytics tables (repo for [PyIceberg](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-python), its Python implementation). 
In this repository, we extend its functionality in Python to allow for data file caching. This provides considerable speed-up for users who do not rely on engines like Spark to read the tables but do use cloud services to store Iceberg files.
